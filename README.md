# Exercise4

In this exercise we read the data of the website Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/).

To make it easier we have accessed the following link: https://www.reddit.com/.json , where we get a JSON representation of the main home page. In order to see it in a better way, we have used Code Beautify (https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer#) and we loaded the Reddit URL.

##How to use it
Once the app is opened, one button will appear: "GETDATA". When it is pressed, all the data will be displayed.
